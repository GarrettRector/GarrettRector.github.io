    Throughout this semester we have used various languages such as Python or Java Script to create and control things
    digitally. This is beneficial to students because it teaches them how to use these digital tools, and then from
    there interests them in other programming languages and other projects. This is how I started. I got introduced
    to the idea of coding at about 7-8, because my dad worked in IT and programming for GM, and wanted to get me interested.
    What really kickstarted programming for me was when I was in 6th grade, and I realized how much python could do for me.
    Python could do AI, Python could do Data Analysis, Python could do all of my math work even up to today, where I
    have finished the 8th grade. And so because of this, I have a lot more python experience and programming experience
    than most. But I still learned from the Auto Auto course, as well as the Java Script course, and I feel like even
    for experienced programmers this course was helpful.

    I think that the addition of the Auto Auto cars was a good idea, but was poorly performed. It was out of your
    control that we had people on zoom, but I feel like zoom ruined it for a lot of people, including me. That said,
    it was out of your control, but I still feel like the digital aspect ruined it. I also think that at least for me,
    Java introduction would have been helpful. I am going to do AP CSP next year and then AP CSA, and CSA is strictly Java.
    So because of this I feel like that if Java had been included in the course at least somewhat, it would have been
    beneficial to me and others. Other than that, the course was pretty enjoyable.
